<!--р - опис персонажу-->
<p>Homer Jay Simpson was born on May 12, 1956 to Abraham Simpson II and Mona Olsen. He was raised on the Simpson family
    farm until they were forced to move out due to Homer jumping out of a hay bale and scaring the cows into giving sour
    milk, causing the bank to foreclose it. At some point in his childhood, Homer began drinking alcohol like his father
    and accidentally caused a traffic jam in a Playskool car.

    His father forced him to attend Camp See-A-Tree, where he went on a date with Marge Bouvier from Camp Land-A-Man;
    unfortunately, he lied about his name and sustained an injury while Marge changed her appearance. Homer then
    accidentally stumbled into Camp Flab-Away and escaped too late to meet with her again, something that left him as
    heartbroken as Marge.[10]

    When Homer was around twelve, his mother went into hiding following a run-in with the law and Abe faked her
    death[38]; before that, she took Homer and Abe to Woodstock, where he ended up briefly adopting the hippie
    lifestyle, much to Abe's disapproval. Homer, along with Lenny, Carl, and Moe, went to a deep gorge to swim but the
    water was drained. When investigating why the lake was reduced to a muddy pit, he stumbled upon a decomposing corpse
    inside a nearby pipe, greatly traumatizing him.

    When he was 15, Homer participated in a drinking contest by lying that he was 22. However, he became so intoxicated
    he ended up drinking a whole beer keg used to fill the other contestants' cups. Eventually he was so hungover he
    missed almost an entire month of school.

    Before beginning high school, Homer convinced Barney to have a beer can while his father was asleep. Barney, an
    aspiring student preparing for Harvard, was annoyed and reluctantly drank it. However, he took to alcohol so quickly
    he nigh-permanently became a worse drunken wreck than Homer and presumably failed his SAT tests.[39]

    Homer attended Springfield High School, falling in love with an older and unrecognizable Marge after she ultimately
    rejected Artie Ziff.[40] After finishing (but not graduating from) high school, Marge and Homer bought an apartment
    at Springfield Place together. During this time, Marge got a letter accepting her into a college. To pay for her
    tuition, Abe gave his son a job at Simpson Laser Tag. The couple broke up for some time after Homer started a grunge
    band called Sadgasm. Marge later realized that she really loved Homer and went back to him.[41] At some point
    between finishing high school and marrying Marge, Homer briefly served in the U.S. Army but never saw combat. Due to
    a clerical error, he was discharged early, and years later, after a disastrous dinner party with his old sergeant,
    Homer was forced to complete his tour of duty.


    Homer and Marge kissing on their wedding day.

    In his early 20s, Homer was working at Sir Putt-A-Lot's Merrie Olde Fun Centre, turning the crank that spun the
    windmill. After a night out with Marge, he learned that he'd prematurely impregnated her with their first child, who
    they decided to name "Bart" if it was a boy. He got married with Marge at Shotgun Pete's, a small wedding chapel
    across the state line. They spent their wedding reception alone at a truck stop before ending up at the Bouvier
    house.

    After failing to get a job at the power plant, Homer eventually left Marge to support his family. He went to work at
    the restaurant Gulp 'n' Blow until Marge convinced him to return home with her. As a result, Homer confronted
    Charles Montgomery Burns and secured a job at the plant.[42] Two years after Bart was born, Marge became pregnant
    again with Lisa shortly before they bought their first house.[43] Homer's second leap to stardom was his success as
    the lead singer and songwriter for the barbershop quartet The Be Sharps, even winning a Grammy. During his time with
    the group, Homer was frequently absent which put stress on his marriage. After the group broke up due to creative
    differences, Homer went back to Springfield.[44]

    When in his 30s, Homer prepared a budget so that he could work at his dream job, a pin monkey at the Bowlarama
    Bowling Alley, owned by Barney's uncle Al Gumble. The budget included buying regular toilet paper and that only one
    of the kids could go to college. Unfortunately for Homer, Marge became pregnant once more with Maggie around this
    time, and he reluctantly went back to the nuclear plant in order to support his family.[45] Since then, Homer has
    started many jobs, but in the end, he always comes back to his job at the Nuclear Plant.</p>

<!--р - опис персонажу-->
<p>Bart is a self-proclaimed underachiever and prankster who is constantly in detention who in addition to his behavior
    is easily distracted. His penchant for shocking people began before he was born, Bart "mooned" Dr. Hibbert while he
    performed a sonogram on Marge when she was pregnant with him, and moments after being born, he set Homer's tie-on
    fire, starting his life as a prankster (Marge saying that he could not have done it on purpose because he was only
    ten minutes old)[12]. Bart's first words were "Ay Caramba"[13] after he walked in on Homer and Marge at a bad time.


    “I hate you.”

    When Lisa was born, Bart got jealous of all the attention Lisa was getting sick and tried to make himself the center
    of attention. Bart eventually couldn’t take it anymore and told Lisa he was running away. Then, Lisa said her first
    word: “Bart!” Bart heard Lisa and realized how much she loved him, and realized he had to stay.

    Bart's interests include Krusty the Clown (he is "Krusty Buddy" number 16302), reading comic books (especially
    Radioactive Man), watching TV (especially The Krusty the Clown Show and The Itchy & Scratchy Show), terrorizing
    Lisa, playing video games, helping Lisa solve various problems (e.g. reuniting Krusty with his estranged Father),
    and pulling off various pranks, (such as mooning unsuspecting people, prank calling Moe at his tavern, and his
    patented spitting off an overpass). Bart also sprays graffiti under the alias 'El Barto', and regularly frequents
    the Kwik-E-Mart (for bubble gum and Squishees) and The Android's Dungeon. Yuma Hickman moved to Springfield when
    Marge was pregnant with Bart.


    Baby Bart

    Bart hinted that his favorite movies are Jaws and the Star Wars trilogy.[14] His best friend is Milhouse Van Houten.


    Young Bart

    Bart is the most misunderstood of the family (After Maggie, who currently can only speak a few words), constantly
    frustrated by the narrow-minded people of Springfield, who judge him merely by his thoughts and actions.</p>

<p>Lisa is quite eclectic in her knowledge and is notably more concerned with world affairs and problems than her
    cohorts, which has led her to alienate herself from her peers. Lisa also deeply values her integrity, sometimes at
    the expense of others' needs and happiness, as demonstrated when she cheats on a test in The Wind in the Willows to
    attain her highest grade of A-plus, but later admits her dishonesty to an unreceptive Principal Skinner despite the
    fact that such a grade allowed the school to gain the extra income it 'desperately' needs. (She later regrades the
    test as an F.[11]) Also, Lisa was willing to tell everyone about Bart faking his own kidnapping to go to a rap
    concert (despite the fact that absolutely everybody involved in the case was better off) just because she could.
    Despite her intellect, Lisa has received detention, like her brother Bart, quite a number of times, often because of
    her rebellious and sometimes bitter attitude and antisocial behavior that is capable of deeply embarrassing
    authority figures. Although her rebellion against social norms is usually constructive, Lisa can be crazy, cruel,
    and rebellious at times. When she believes herself to be right she won't admit that others could be as well, and
    will often force her beliefs onto people. Notably, her increasing sense of moral righteousness regarding her
    vegetarianism leads her to proselytize, culminating in her spiteful disruption of a "meat-based" barbecue prepared
    by Homer (an act she comes to rue).[12] At times, Lisa appears to resist certain situations merely for the sake of
    resisting them, not because of any genuine ideological opposition. She appears to enjoy breaking the norm for its
    own sake; in one time, she triumphantly declares that she, a girl, would like to join the football team. When it is
    revealed that there are already girls on the team, she declares her distaste for a sport that would use a pig's skin
    to make its ball. When it is revealed that the ball is actually synthetic and the proceeds of buying it go in part
    to charity, she is at a loss for words and runs off visibly upset.[13] She also seems to dislike having her
    intellect challenged, which is evident on occasions such as when she was temporarily promoted to the third grade or
    when Miss Hoover gave her a B+ on her final grade for conduct and actually caused her physical harm because of it.
    Lisa's first word was Bart at two years of age. Despite her high IQ, cuteness, and beauty, Lisa does have typical
    childhood issues, sometimes requiring adult intervention. She once tricked Homer into allowing her to ride the bus
    alone, only to become hopelessly lost. After his coworkers Lenny and Carl point out that he allowed his daughter to
    ride a bus by herself, Homer comes to her rescue.[14] Lisa has a Jewish imaginary friend named Rachel Cohen who
    "just got into Brandeis University." Even with a high intellect, Lisa displays personality traits typical for her
    age, including obsessing over getting a pony, being addicted to TV, and fighting with Bart. Lisa once got addicted
    to secondhand smoke to maintain an impressive level of ballet competence; Homer tries to prevent the addiction
    unsuccessfully, and in the end, Lisa overcomes the addiction herself through means of "Hello Kitty" nicotine
    patches.[15] She also displays a surprising amount of skill in driving, especially for her age, sometimes even
    taking the wheel whenever Homer ended up distracted from driving.[16] In "The Girl Who Slept Too Little", she
    struggled with nightmares after a cemetery was moved next to the Simpsons' house. She overcame her fear after
    spending a night in the cemetery and realized that it was acceptable to suffer from fear despite her intelligence.
    It was revealed in this episode that Lisa largely had to raise herself due to Homer and Marge dealing with Bart's
    antics thus ensuring a lack of nurturing for her. Lisa has been known in earlier seasons to have a bit of a sassy
    attitude. Like Bart and most siblings in families, Lisa has been known to tease Bart herself, examples such as;
    crushes Bart has developed, or advice on writing to someone (in this one case, his teacher), even just plain sassing
    him for attention. Deep down inside, Lisa loves her brother deeply.</p>
